                    <h3>Chandler Bing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Chandler Muriel Bing is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by Matthew Perry.
                         He was born to Nora Tyler Bing (Morgan Fairchild), an erotic romance novelist, 
                         and Charles Bing (Kathleen Turner), a gay female impersonator and star of a Las Vegas drag show called
                         "Viva Las Gay-gas" as Helena Handbasket. He is of Scottish and Swedish ancestry.
                         He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family.
                         Chandler's parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, 
                         an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood and develop his notorious sense
                         of humour as a defense mechanism. It is revealed in season 1 that he went to an all-boys high school.

                         Chandler's best friend is Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), who is his roommate. 
                         He previously lived with his good friend Ross Geller (David Schwimmer). He met Ross' sister,
                         Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), and her friend, Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston),
                         while celebrating Thanksgiving at Ross' parents' house. Chandler was the first person to 
                         know about Ross' love for Rachel. He moved to New York City and lives across the hall from Monica
                          and, through her, meets Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow). Chandler has a very good sense of humor, 
                          and is notoriously sarcastic. He attributes his sarcasm as a defense mechanism he developed due to his
                         parents' divorcing when he was a child. He is the highest earning member of his friends' circle on account
                         of responsible income management, having learned the value of money from a young age.
                          He suffers from commitment issues, but later marries Monica at the end of season 7. In season 10,
                          he and Monica go on to adopt twins.
