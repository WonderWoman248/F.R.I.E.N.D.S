                    <h3>Rachel Green</h3>
                    <p>
                         Rachel Karen Green is a fictional character, one of the six main characters who appeared in the American sitcom 
                         Friends. Portrayed by Jennifer Aniston, the character was created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and appeared
                         in all of the show's 236 episodes during its decade-long run, from its premiere on September 22, 1994 to its finale 
                          May 6, 2004. Introduced in the show's pilot as a naïve runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend 
                          Monica Geller and relocates to New York City, Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled, inexperienced "daddy's girl"
                           into a successful businesswoman. During the show's second season, the character becomes romantically involved with 
                           Monica's brother, Ross, with whom she maintains a complicated on-off relationship throughout the series. Together,
                            Ross and Rachel have a daughter, Emma.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         The role of Rachel was originally offered to Téa Leoni, the producer's first choice, and Courteney Cox,
                         both of whom declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth, and Cox in favor of playing 
                         Rachel's best friend Monica in Friends.
                          A virtually unknown actress at the time, who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms,
                         Aniston auditioned for the role of Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy 
                         show Saturday Night Live. After acquiring the role and before Friends aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk
                         of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, Muddling Through, at the time, which
                         was ultimately cancelled and allowed Aniston to remain on Friends.


                    <br>
                     Critical reception towards Rachel has remained consistently positive throughout Friends
                     ' decade-long run, with The A.V. Club attributing much of the show's early success to the character. 
                     However, some of her storylines have been criticized, specifically her romantic relationship with her friend 
                     Joey Tribbiani during season 10. Rachel's popularity established her as the show's breakout character, who has 
                     since been named one of the greatest television characters of all time, while the character's second season haircut 
                     ned an international phenomenon of its own. Named the "Rachel" after her, the character's shag continues to be imitated
                     by millions of women around the world and remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history, in spite of Aniston 
                     personally disliking it. Rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s.
                      Meanwhile, the character's relationship with Ross is often cited among television's most beloved.
