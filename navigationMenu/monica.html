                    <h3>Monica Gellar</h3>
                    <p>
                        Monica E. Geller-Bing is a fictional character, one of the six main characters who appears on
                         the American sitcom Friends (1994â€“2004). Created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and portrayed 
                         by actress Courteney Cox, Monica appears all of the show's 236 episodes, from its premiere in 1994,
                          to its finale in 2004. A chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and obsessive-compulsive 
                          nature, Monica is the younger sister of Ross Geller and best friend of Rachel Green, the latter of
                           whom she invites to live with her after Rachel forsakes her own wedding. The two characters spend 
                           several years living together as roommates until Monica begins a romantic relationship with long-time 
                           neighbor and friend Chandler Bing, whom she marries. Unable to conceive children on their own, Chandler
                            and Monica eventually adopt twins Erica and Jack and move out of their apartment into a larger house in the suburbs.

                         The creators' first choice for the role of Monica was comedian Janeane Garofalo.
                          Cox had originally been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing 
                          the character's best friend Monica because she was drawn to her strong personality. 
                          Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress Jennifer Aniston, Cox' co-star to whom 
                          the role of Monica had originally been offered. Before Friends aired, Monica's characterization
                         was greatly debated among writers in regards to the character sleeping with a man on their first
                         date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive Don
                          Ohlmeyer over whether or not this would make the character too promiscuous. Ultimately, the episode 
                           aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica's
                            existing storyline. The character's struggles with childhood obesity, challenges with romantic relationships 
                            and complicated relationship with her mother would eventually become popular staples of the show.
