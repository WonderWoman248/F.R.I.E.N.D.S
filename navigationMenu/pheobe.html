                    <h3>Pheobe Buffay</h3>
                    <p>
                        Phoebe Buffay is a fictional character, portrayed by Lisa Kudrow, one of the six main characters from the
                         American sitcom Friends, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman. Phoebe was born on February 16 and 
                         is the daughter of Frank and Lily Buffay. Her birth mother's name was Phoebe Abbott, for whom she was named
                          after. Phoebe has a twin sister, Ursula, who is also portrayed by Kudrow. Phoebe can speak several languages,
                         including French and Italian. She appeared in all of the show's 236 episodes. She is a masseuse and musician,
                         notable for her offbeat and extremely ditzy behavior. She was Monica Geller's roommate before Rachel Green,
                         which is how she was introduced to the group. Phoebe is best friends with Monica and Rachel, along with their
                          neighbors, Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani, and also Monica's brother Ross Geller. She plays a Gibson Gospel
                         and sings at Central Perk. During the show's ninth season, Phoebe and Joey decide to choose a blind date for 
                         each other. Phoebe finds someone for him, but Joey forgets about their deal and doesn't find anyone for her.
                         So a couple of minutes before the date, Joey accidentally finds Mike who agrees to go on a blind date with
                           Phoebe. Mike Hannigan (played by actor Paul Rudd) and Phoebe begin a romantic relationship. They later get 
                         engaged and then marry.
